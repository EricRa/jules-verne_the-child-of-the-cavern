THE FORD FAMILY</h2>

<p>
Ten minutes afterwards, James Starr and Harry issued from the principal
gallery. They were now standing in a glade, if we may use this word to
designate a vast and dark excavation. The place, however, was not entirely
deprived of daylight. A few rays straggled in through the opening of a deserted
shaft. It was by means of this pipe that ventilation was established in the
Dochart pit. Owing to its lesser density, the warm air was drawn towards the
Yarrow shaft. Both air and light, therefore, penetrated in some measure into
the glade.
</p>

<p>
Here Simon Ford had lived with his family ten years, in a subterranean
dwelling, hollowed out in the schistous mass, where formerly stood the powerful
engines which worked the mechanical traction of the Dochart pit.
</p>

<p>
Such was the habitation, &ldquo;his cottage,&rdquo; as he called it, in which
resided the old overman. As he had some means saved during a long life of toil,
Ford could have afforded to live in the light of day, among trees, or in any
town of the kingdom he chose, but he and his wife and son preferred remaining
in the mine, where they were happy together, having the same opinions, ideas,
and tastes. Yes, they were quite fond of their cottage, buried fifteen hundred
feet below Scottish soil. Among other advantages, there was no fear that tax
gatherers, or rent collectors would ever come to trouble its inhabitants.
</p>

<p>
At this period, Simon Ford, the former overman of the Dochart pit, bore the
weight of sixty-five years well. Tall, robust, well-built, he would have been
regarded as one of the most conspicuous men in the district which supplies so
many fine fellows to the Highland regiments.
</p>

<p>
Simon Ford was descended from an old mining family, and his ancestors had
worked the very first carboniferous seams opened in Scotland. Without
discussing whether or not the Greeks and Romans made use of coal, whether the
Chinese worked coal mines before the Christian era, whether the French word for
coal (<i>houille</i>) is really derived from the farrier Houillos, who lived in
Belgium in the twelfth century, we may affirm that the beds in Great Britain
were the first ever regularly worked. So early as the eleventh century, William
the Conqueror divided the produce of the Newcastle bed among his
companions-in-arms. At the end of the thirteenth century, a license for the
mining of &ldquo;sea coal&rdquo; was granted by Henry III. Lastly, towards the
end of the same century, mention is made of the Scotch and Welsh beds.
</p>

<p>
It was about this time that Simon Ford&rsquo;s ancestors penetrated into the
bowels of Caledonian earth, and lived there ever after, from father to son.
They were but plain miners. They labored like convicts at the work of
extracting the precious combustible. It is even believed that the coal miners,
like the salt-makers of that period, were actual slaves.
</p>

<p>
However that might have been, Simon Ford was proud of belonging to this ancient
family of Scotch miners. He had worked diligently in the same place where his
ancestors had wielded the pick, the crowbar, and the mattock. At thirty he was
overman of the Dochart pit, the most important in the Aberfoyle colliery. He
was devoted to his trade. During long years he zealously performed his duty.
His only grief had been to perceive the bed becoming impoverished, and to see
the hour approaching when the seam would be exhausted.
</p>

<p>
It was then he devoted himself to the search for new veins in all the Aberfoyle
pits, which communicated underground one with another. He had had the good luck
to discover several during the last period of the working. His miner&rsquo;s
instinct assisted him marvelously, and the engineer, James Starr, appreciated
him highly. It might be said that he divined the course of seams in the depths
of the coal mine as a hydroscope reveals springs in the bowels of the earth. He
was <i>par excellence</i> the type of a miner whose whole existence is
indissolubly connected with that of his mine. He had lived there from his
birth, and now that the works were abandoned he wished to live there still. His
son Harry foraged for the subterranean housekeeping; as for himself, during
those ten years he had not been ten times above ground.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Go up there! What is the good?&rdquo; he would say, and refused to leave
his black domain. The place was remarkably healthy, subject to an equable
temperature; the old overman endured neither the heat of summer nor the cold of
winter. His family enjoyed good health; what more could he desire?
</p>

<p>
But at heart he felt depressed. He missed the former animation, movement, and
life in the well-worked pit. He was, however, supported by one fixed idea.
&ldquo;No, no! the mine is not exhausted!&rdquo; he repeated.
</p>

<p>
And that man would have given serious offense who could have ventured to
express before Simon Ford any doubt that old Aberfoyle would one day revive! He
had never given up the hope of discovering some new bed which would restore the
mine to its past splendor. Yes, he would willingly, had it been necessary, have
resumed the miner&rsquo;s pick, and with his still stout arms vigorously
attacked the rock. He went through the dark galleries, sometimes alone,
sometimes with his son, examining, searching for signs of coal, only to return
each day, wearied, but not in despair, to the cottage.
</p>

<p>
Madge, Simon&rsquo;s faithful companion, his &ldquo;gude-wife,&rdquo; to use
the Scotch term, was a tall, strong, comely woman. Madge had no wish to leave
the Dochart pit any more than had her husband. She shared all his hopes and
regrets. She encouraged him, she urged him on, and talked to him in a way which
cheered the heart of the old overman. &ldquo;Aberfoyle is only asleep,&rdquo;
she would say. &ldquo;You are right about that, Simon. This is but a rest, it
is not death!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Madge, as well as the others, was perfectly satisfied to live independent of
the outer world, and was the center of the happiness enjoyed by the little
family in their dark cottage.
</p>

<p>
The engineer was eagerly expected. Simon Ford was standing at his door, and as
soon as Harry&rsquo;s lamp announced the arrival of his former viewer he
advanced to meet him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Welcome, Mr. Starr!&rdquo; he exclaimed, his voice echoing under the
roof of schist. &ldquo;Welcome to the old overman&rsquo;s cottage! Though it is
buried fifteen hundred feet under the earth, our house is not the less
hospitable.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And how are you, good Simon?&rdquo; asked James Starr, grasping the hand
which his host held out to him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very well, Mr. Starr. How could I be otherwise here, sheltered from the
inclemencies of the weather? Your ladies who go to Newhaven or Portobello in
the summer time would do much better to pass a few months in the coal mine of
Aberfoyle! They would run no risk here of catching a heavy cold, as they do in
the damp streets of the old capital.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not the man to contradict you, Simon,&rdquo; answered James
Starr, glad to find the old man just as he used to be. &ldquo;Indeed, I wonder
why I do not change my home in the Canongate for a cottage near you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And why not, Mr. Starr? I know one of your old miners who would be truly
pleased to have only a partition wall between you and him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And how is Madge?&rdquo; asked the engineer.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The goodwife is in better health than I am, if that&rsquo;s
possible,&rdquo; replied Ford, &ldquo;and it will be a pleasure to her to see
you at her table. I think she will surpass herself to do you honor.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We shall see that, Simon, we shall see that!&rdquo; said the engineer,
to whom the announcement of a good breakfast could not be indifferent, after
his long walk.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are you hungry, Mr. Starr?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ravenously hungry. My journey has given me an appetite. I came through
horrible weather.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, it is raining up there,&rdquo; responded Simon Ford.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, Simon, and the waters of the Forth are as rough as the sea.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, Mr. Starr, here it never rains. But I needn&rsquo;t describe to
you all the advantages, which you know as well as myself. Here we are at the
cottage. That is the chief thing, and I again say you are welcome, sir.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Simon Ford, followed by Harry, ushered their guest into the dwelling. James
Starr found himself in a large room lighted by numerous lamps, one hanging from
the colored beams of the roof.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The soup is ready, wife,&rdquo; said Ford, &ldquo;and it mustn&rsquo;t
be kept waiting any more than Mr. Starr. He is as hungry as a miner, and he
shall see that our boy doesn&rsquo;t let us want for anything in the cottage!
By-the-bye, Harry,&rdquo; added the old overman, turning to his son,
&ldquo;Jack Ryan came here to see you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know, father. We met him in the Yarrow shaft.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s an honest and a merry fellow,&rdquo; said Ford; &ldquo;but he
seems to be quite happy above ground. He hasn&rsquo;t the true miner&rsquo;s
blood in his veins. Sit down, Mr. Starr, and have a good dinner, for we may not
sup till late.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
As the engineer and his hosts were taking their places:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;One moment, Simon,&rdquo; said James Starr. &ldquo;Do you want me to eat
with a good appetite?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It will be doing us all possible honor, Mr. Starr,&rdquo; answered Ford.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, in order to eat heartily, I must not be at all anxious. Now I have
two questions to put to you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Go on, sir.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Your letter told me of a communication which was to be of an interesting
nature.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is very interesting indeed.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To you and to me, Mr. Starr. But I do not want to tell it you until
after dinner, and on the very spot itself. Without that you would not believe
me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Simon,&rdquo; resumed the engineer, &ldquo;look me straight in the face.
An interesting communication? Yes. Good! I will not ask more,&rdquo; he added,
as if he had read the reply in the old overman&rsquo;s eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And the second question?&rdquo; asked the latter.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you know, Simon, who the person is who can have written this?&rdquo;
answered the engineer, handing him the anonymous letter.
</p>

<p>
Ford took the letter and read it attentively. Then giving it to his son,
&ldquo;Do you know the writing?&rdquo; he asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, father,&rdquo; replied Harry.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And had this letter the Aberfoyle postmark?&rdquo; inquired Simon Ford.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, like yours,&rdquo; replied James Starr.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do you think of that, Harry?&rdquo; said his father, his brow
darkening.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think, father,&rdquo; returned Harry, &ldquo;that someone has had some
interest in trying to prevent Mr. Starr from coming to the place where you
invited him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But who,&rdquo; exclaimed the old miner, &ldquo;who could have possibly
guessed enough of my secret?&rdquo; And Simon fell into a reverie, from which
he was aroused by his wife.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let us begin, Mr. Starr,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The soup is already
getting cold. Don&rsquo;t think any more of that letter just now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
On the old woman&rsquo;s invitation, each drew in his chair, James Starr
opposite to Madge&mdash;to do him honor&mdash;the father and son opposite to
each other. It was a good Scotch dinner. First they ate
&ldquo;hotchpotch,&rdquo; soup with the meat swimming in capital broth. As old
Simon said, his wife knew no rival in the art of preparing hotchpotch. It was
the same with the &ldquo;cockyleeky,&rdquo; a cock stewed with leeks, which
merited high praise. The whole was washed down with excellent ale, obtained
from the best brewery in Edinburgh.
</p>

<p>
But the principal dish consisted of a &ldquo;haggis,&rdquo; the national
pudding, made of meat and barley meal. This remarkable dish, which inspired the
poet Burns with one of his best odes, shared the fate of all the good things in
this world&mdash;it passed away like a dream.
</p>

<p>
Madge received the sincere compliments of her guest. The dinner ended with
cheese and oatcake, accompanied by a few small glasses of
&ldquo;usquebaugh,&rdquo; capital whisky, five and twenty years old&mdash;just
Harry&rsquo;s age. The repast lasted a good hour. James Starr and Simon Ford
had not only eaten much, but talked much too, chiefly of their past life in the
old Aberfoyle mine.
</p>

<p>
Harry had been rather silent. Twice he had left the table, and even the house.
He evidently felt uneasy since the incident of the stone, and wished to examine
the environs of the cottage. The anonymous letter had not contributed to
reassure him.
</p>

<p>
Whilst he was absent, the engineer observed to Ford and his wife,
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a fine lad you have there, my friends.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, Mr. Starr, he is a good and affectionate son,&rdquo; replied the
old overman earnestly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is he happy with you in the cottage?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He would not wish to leave us.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think of finding him a wife, some day?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A wife for Harry,&rdquo; exclaimed Ford. &ldquo;And who would it be? A
girl from up yonder, who would love merry-makings and dancing, who would prefer
her clan to our mine! Harry wouldn&rsquo;t do it!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Simon,&rdquo; said Madge, &ldquo;you would not forbid that Harry should
take a wife.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I would forbid nothing,&rdquo; returned the old miner, &ldquo;but
there&rsquo;s no hurry about that. Who knows but we may find one for
him&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Harry re-entered at that moment, and Simon Ford was silent.
</p>

<p>
When Madge rose from the table, all followed her example, and seated themselves
at the door of the cottage. &ldquo;Well, Simon,&rdquo; said the engineer,
&ldquo;I am ready to hear you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mr. Starr,&rdquo; responded Ford, &ldquo;I do not need your ears, but
your legs. Are you quite rested?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Quite rested and quite refreshed, Simon. I am ready to go with you
wherever you like.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Harry,&rdquo; said Simon Ford, turning to his son, &ldquo;light our
safety lamps.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are you going to take safety lamps!&rdquo; exclaimed James Starr, in
amazement, knowing that there was no fear of explosions of fire-damp in a pit
quite empty of coal.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, Mr. Starr, it will be prudent.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My good Simon, won&rsquo;t you propose next to put me in a miner&rsquo;s
dress?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not just yet, sir, not just yet!&rdquo; returned the old overman, his
deep-set eyes gleaming strangely.
</p>

<p>
Harry soon reappeared, carrying three safety lamps. He handed one of these to
the engineer, the other to his father, and kept the third hanging from his left
hand, whilst his right was armed with a long stick.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Forward!&rdquo; said Simon Ford, taking up a strong pick, which was
leaning against the wall of the cottage.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Forward!&rdquo; echoed the engineer. &ldquo;Good-by, Madge.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>God</i> speed you!&rdquo; responded the good woman.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A good supper, wife, do you hear?&rdquo; exclaimed Ford. &ldquo;We shall
be hungry when we come back, and will do it justice!&rdquo;
